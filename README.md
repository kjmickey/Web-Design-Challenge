# Web-Design-Challenge

This is the HTML and CSS homework for Bootcampspot.com Data Science class, Winter 2021.

+++ I am somewhat color-blind so excuse the colors if they are awful. +++

We will take data from a previous homework and use it to build a 7 page website.

Requirements include using bootstrap for the nav-bar and grid layout, a css stylesheet to control the appearance and the ability to display the screen on different size screens.
